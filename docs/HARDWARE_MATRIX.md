# GuardOS Hardware Compatibility Matrix

> GuardOS targets **PC-class, x86_64 machines** with unlocked firmware and support for local AI inference.  
> It is not a Linux distro ‚Äî it is a full secure operating system with offline AI and policy-based tooling.

## üîß Testing Phases

| Phase | Hardware Focus                  | Goals                          |
|-------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Phase 1 | Libreboot ThinkPads (X230, T430) | Profile testing, safe shell tools |
| Phase 2 | Coreboot modern ThinkPads       | GPU test, power sandboxing     |
| Phase 3 | Pine64 or RISC-V dev boards     | Stretch: embedded GuardOS-lite |
| Phase 4 | Hardened multi-core systems     | Run full LLM (Phi-2) locally   |

## üß© How to Contribute Hardware Reports

If you test GuardOS tools on your device (even in shell-only mode):

1. Create a new issue using the `hardware.yaml` template.
2. Include:
   - CPU, RAM, GPU, firmware type (Libreboot/Coreboot/etc)
   - Whether `guardpanel/cli.sh` works
   - Whether `hunter/` detects your logs
   - Any failures or suggestions

Community-confirmed devices will be added to this list in future updates.
