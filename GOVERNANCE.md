# Governance

- **Maintainers**: steward technical direction and releases.
- **Security WG**: triages vulnerabilities, sets hardening priorities.
- **Community WG**: onboarding, docs, outreach.
- **Decisions**: ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) in `docs/adr/` (to be added).
- **Elections/Changes**: proposed via RFCs; lazy consensus, escalate to vote if needed.

Conflicts of interest must be disclosed. Security WG has final say in emergencies.
