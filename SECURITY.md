# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in GuardOS, please report it **privately** via GitHub:

👉 [Report a vulnerability](../../security/advisories/new)

This ensures responsible disclosure and coordinated fixes with the core team.

## Coordination Process

- Vulnerabilities are reviewed privately
- Fixes are published along with public advisories
- Contributors may be credited if they opt in
