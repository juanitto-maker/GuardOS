# GuardOS — AI‑Armored Personal Operating System (Open Source)

**GuardOS** hardens an individual computer (“cell”) using a layered (Onion) model:
- Immutable base OS + verified boot
- Strict app sandboxing & per‑app firewall
- Local AI for anomaly detection + explainable prompts
- Zero‑trust defaults, zero‑knowledge (opt‑in cloud)

> Goal: “Military‑grade” resilience for everyday users, without breaking normal computing.

## Why GuardOS?
Traditional security focuses on the perimeter. Modern attacks move across layers: firmware, boot, OS, apps, network, cloud, and user. GuardOS defends **each layer** and binds them with a **local AI** (“Aegis”) that explains risk and suggests safe actions.

## Core Principles
- **Local‑first AI** (offline by default)
- **Zero trust on a single machine**
- **Immutable base, atomic rollback**
- **Explainable security prompts**
- **Open, auditable, reproducible builds**
